## What is this for?
This Discord bot copies a certain user's text in a channel. This is mainly for Roblox Limited Code Sniping, but you can do anything with this if you want.

## Note
If ```Status Code: 401``` occurs, you entered your token incorrectly

If you see ```Respond: 200```, it's working

### **Installation**
